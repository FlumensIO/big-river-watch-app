          is an invitation for communities to love their local river and to be
          part of the movement demanding better for our rivers. It consists of a
          free app containing a simple survey, and anybody in the UK and Ireland
          who can access a river can take part â€“ all you need to do is spend a
          little time watching your local watercourse and answering the
          questions. All of the survey data will provide a large-scale picture
          of river health, and help us fight for better for our rivers.
