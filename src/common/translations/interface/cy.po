"Beavers are becoming more common across the UK. These large, semi-aquatic "

msgstr ""

# /home/wildlife

"By a river in the summer, you might spot a variety of different sized and "
"coloured dragonflies and dameselflies; These are thin insects with dark "
"wings, large heads and long abdomens and are often seen hovering and flying "
"over and around the water. The wings on a resting dragonfly extend out to "
"the sides of their body, while the wings on a resting damselfly, which are "

"Ducks are common in many waterways. There are many different species of "

msgstr ""

"These small birds have slate grey plumage on their upper parts, but their "
